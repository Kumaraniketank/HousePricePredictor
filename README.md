Introduction
HousePricePredictor leverages machine learning models to predict house prices based on various features like location, size, number of bedrooms, etc. The project uses popular regression techniques such as Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge Regression to provide accurate predictions. The predictions are accessible via a web interface built using Python Flask, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience.

Features
Predict house prices based on input features
Uses multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge
Responsive web interface built with Flask
Easy-to-use API for integration
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Flask
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Jinja2 (for templating in Flask)
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Kumaraniketank/HousePricePredictor.git
cd HousePricePredictor
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
flask run
Access the web interface:
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5001

Usage
Web Interface
Open the web interface in your browser.
Enter the required details (location, size, number of bedrooms, etc.).
Click on the 'Predict' button to get the predicted house price.
API
You can also access the prediction functionality via the API.

Endpoint: /predict
Method: POST
Parameters: JSON object with house features (e.g., location, size, etc.)
Example Request
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"location": "Whitefield", "sqft": 1200,"bhk":4, "bathrooms": 3}'
Example Response
json
Copy code
{
  "predicted_price": 8500000
}
Models
The project uses the following machine learning models:

Linear Regression: A basic regression technique to model the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
Lasso Regression: A regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance prediction accuracy.
Ridge Regression: A technique used to analyze multiple regression data that suffer from multicollinearity.
The models are trained on a dataset of Bangalore house prices and can be easily retrained with new data.

API Endpoints
/: Home page of the web application.
/predict: Endpoint to get the house price prediction.
